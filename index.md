## Projects
### Project 1

2023 Travelers Analytics Case Competition, Oct 2023- Dec 2023
- Link: [[Link to my medium story: Navigating Imbalanced Car Insurance Claim Data with Pervasive 0 Values](https://medium.com/@wosunday8769/navigating-imbalanced-car-insurance-claim-data-with-pervasive-0-values-37c67879c3e7)]
-	Led the design and implementation of a customized XGBoost regression model to forecast car insurance claim costs leveraging user data.
-	Spearheaded a 56.7% enhancement in predictive accuracy compared to the established benchmark model, showcasing the efficacy of the tailored XGBoost regression methodology.
-	Provided actionable insights into pivotal factors influencing car insurance claim costs, empowering informed strategic decision-making for the business partner.

### Project 2

A GIS dashboard project focusing on COPD in in Connecticut:
This dashboard shows COPD cases in Connecticut from 2001 to 2014, by population density. It's easy to use and lets you see how COPD cases have changed over time and where they're most common across different counties in Connecticut. By comparing COPD cases to population numbers, you can see which areas have more cases per person. You can also filter the data to focus on specific regions to get more detailed information. This helps people understand where COPD is a bigger issue and make decisions about how to address it.
- Data Collection and Preprocess:
- Create Map with GIS Online:
Import the preprocessed data into a GIS online platform.
Create a map showing locations, with customizable symbols and additional layers for context.
Create GIS Dashboard:
- Develop an interactive dashboard displaying the map and additional visualizations.

### Project 3

A GIS dashboard project focusing on museums in Connecticut:

- Data Collection and Preprocess:
Gather museum data including locations, population in county, and other relevant details.
- Create Map with GIS Online:
Import the preprocessed data into a GIS online platform.
Create a map showing museum locations, with customizable symbols and additional layers for context.
Create GIS Dashboard:
- Develop an interactive dashboard displaying the map and additional visualizations.
Provide details about number of museum in CT.

### Project 4

Medical insurance claim approval prediction using statistical models, Nov 2023 - Dec 2023
- Link: [[Link to my medium story: Medical insurance claim approval prediction project using statistical models from R](https://medium.com/@wosunday8769/medical-insurance-claim-approval-prediction-project-using-statistical-models-from-r-8f3fb8bef34c)]
- Analyzed data from medical insurance policyholders to uncover correlations among factors and predict insurance claim approvals using statistical classification methodologies (LM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with R.
- Identified Random Forest as the most robust model, excelling in Precision(0.862), Recall(0.868), Accuracy(0.853), and F1 Score(0.865). Additionally, XGBoost demonstrated competitive performance across metrics.

### Project 5
