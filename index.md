## Projects
### Project 1

2023 Travelers Analytics Case Competition, Oct 2023- Dec 2023
-	Led the design and implementation of a customized XGBoost regression model to forecast car insurance claim costs leveraging user data.
-	Spearheaded a 56.7% enhancement in predictive accuracy compared to the established benchmark model, showcasing the efficacy of the tailored XGBoost regression methodology.
-	Provided actionable insights into pivotal factors influencing car insurance claim costs, empowering informed strategic decision-making for the business partner.

### Project 2

Medical insurance claim approval prediction using statistical models, Nov 2023 - Dec 2023
- Analyzed data from medical insurance policyholders to uncover correlations among factors and predict insurance claim approvals using statistical classification methodologies (LM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with R.
- Identified Random Forest as the most robust model, excelling in Precision(0.862), Recall(0.868), Accuracy(0.853), and F1 Score(0.865). Additionally, XGBoost demonstrated competitive performance across metrics.
