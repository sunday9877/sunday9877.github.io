## Projects
### Project 1

2023 Travelers Analytics Case Competition, Oct 2023- Dec 2023
- Link: [[Link to my medium story: Navigating Imbalanced Car Insurance Claim Data with Pervasive 0 Values](https://medium.com/@wosunday8769/navigating-imbalanced-car-insurance-claim-data-with-pervasive-0-values-37c67879c3e7)]
-	Led the design and implementation of a customized XGBoost regression model to forecast car insurance claim costs leveraging user data.
-	Spearheaded a 56.7% enhancement in predictive accuracy compared to the established benchmark model, showcasing the efficacy of the tailored XGBoost regression methodology.
-	Provided actionable insights into pivotal factors influencing car insurance claim costs, empowering informed strategic decision-making for the business partner.

### Project 2

A GIS dashboard project focusing on museums in Connecticut:

- Data Collection and Preprocess:
Gather museum data including locations, population in county, and other relevant details.
- Create Map with GIS Online:
Import the preprocessed data into a GIS online platform.
Create a map showing museum locations, with customizable symbols and additional layers for context.
Create GIS Dashboard:
- Develop an interactive dashboard displaying the map and additional visualizations.
Provide details about number of museum in CT.

### Project 3

Medical insurance claim approval prediction using statistical models, Nov 2023 - Dec 2023
- Link: [[Link to my medium story: Medical insurance claim approval prediction project using statistical models from R](https://medium.com/@wosunday8769/medical-insurance-claim-approval-prediction-project-using-statistical-models-from-r-8f3fb8bef34c)]
- Analyzed data from medical insurance policyholders to uncover correlations among factors and predict insurance claim approvals using statistical classification methodologies (LM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with R.
- Identified Random Forest as the most robust model, excelling in Precision(0.862), Recall(0.868), Accuracy(0.853), and F1 Score(0.865). Additionally, XGBoost demonstrated competitive performance across metrics.

### Project 4

Satellite data processiong and visulization
- **Description:** â€¢	Satellite aerosol data analysis: Data Acquisition, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Image Classification, and Interpretation.
- **GitHub Repository:** [[Link to my project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/sunday9877/satellite_data)]
- **Demo:** Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) RGB image ![SEVIRI RGB image](pic/SEVIRI_20180502041511.png)
